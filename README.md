# Go lang server using net/http package

Simple HTTP backend with Go using the net/http package and adding 2 endpoints serving GET requests

To run locally:

- `go run github.com/jmeisele/golang_http`

This will spin up the webserver on port 8081. Open a browser window and go to `http://localhost:8081/` to see our simple home page or `http://localhost:8081/second` to see our second page.
